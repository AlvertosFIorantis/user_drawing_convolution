# Predicting handwritten digits (MNIST)
The reason i crated this project is the fact that there are many tutorials on the MNIST dataset but none of them explains on how to make predictions on new data.
This a simple flask REST API. The front end has a canvas HTML that allows the user to draw a number. We have simple convolution neural network created on Tensorflow as a backend which makes all the predictions.
